Due to the nature of the situation, we have decided to cancel all in-person events for the remainder of 2020, as well as our in-person Divacups & Lunapads office hours. We are trying to restock resources as often as we can, but we anticipate being unable to do so on a regular basis. The space is not open for use. Please check back here for updates. We have members who are, or who live with folks that are immunocompromised, young, elderly, and with pre-existing health conditions. This greatly informs out decision, as well as our priority to maintain the health and safety of our community. We apologize for the inconvenience that this can cause our folks who share the space and rely on our resources. During this time of uncertainty, we thank you for your understanding and cooperations and will keep you informed if anything changes. Take care and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at ubcwomenscentre@gmail.com.
